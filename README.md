Welcome to the JAWN Coffee website, where we offer high-quality specialty coffee for your special events. Our mobile coffee cart can be easily set up at any location to provide your guests with delicious, artisanal coffee made from the finest ingredients.

This project utilizes [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for complex animations and [Emailjs](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-send-emails-from-a-form-in-react-emailjs-6cdd21bb4190) to give potential clients the ability to send emails for business inquiries directly from the site.
